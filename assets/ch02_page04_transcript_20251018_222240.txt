00:00 Narrator: Senku reveals that the 'love potion' was just ordinary gasoline made from plastic bottle caps, much to the shock of Taiju and others, while Senku smirks to himself.
00:09 Taiju: HUH?
00:10 Taiju: I DUN GEDDIT.
00:11 Taiju: SO Taiju WOULD'VE DIED IF HE DRANK IT?
00:14 Senku: IT'S MERELY LONG GASOLINE MOLECULES CHOPPED UP BY A FEW HYDROCARBONS. SIMPLE ENOUGH TO UNDERSTAND.
00:20 Senku: JUST THINK ABOUT THE ATOMIC STRUCTURE OF POLY-ETHYLENE, YOU FOOLS!
00:24 Taiju: WAS THAT REALLY A LOVE POTION, Senku...?
00:27 Senku: OF COURSE NOT. IT'S JUST ORDINARY GASOLINE. I PRODUCED IT FROM PLASTIC BOTTLE CAPS.
00:33 Senku: HEH HEH... I WAS TEN BILLION PERCENT SURE HE WOULDN'T DRINK IT.
00:39 Senku: HE'S AN HONEST FOOL.
