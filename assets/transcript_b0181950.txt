00:00 Narrator: Eren and Mikasa are walking through town and overhear Garrison soldiers, including Hannes, speaking dismissively about the Survey Corps. This angers Eren, who loudly compares living inside the walls to being a caged animal, attracting the attention of the soldiers and other passersby.

00:18 Garrison Soldier 2: HELL... I CAN'T UNDERSTAND THOSE GUYS IN THE SURVEY CORPS WHO WANNA GO OUTSIDE THE WALL!
00:23 Garrison Soldier 2: BUT IF THEY WANNA HAVE FUN PLAYING WAR, LET 'EM, I SAY!!

00:29 Eren Jaeger: WE CAN EAT, SLEEP AND SURVIVE JUST FINE HERE... BUT...
00:34 Eren Jaeger: ...ISN'T THAT...
