  "ambient": "The atmosphere is grand and slightly imposing, emphasizing the massive scale of the walls that protect the city. The sound of wind suggests a high altitude and an open, expansive environment. The scene is quiet otherwise, setting a peaceful but contained tone for the city within. | A tense but one-sided confrontation near the city wall. The atmosphere is filled with the soldiers' casual, drunken complacency clashing with Eren's youthful and urgent fear. | A relatively peaceful and busy street in the Shiganshina District. The sounds of townspeople walking and talking can be heard, contrasting with the intense emotions of the main characters. | A bustling daytime street scene within a walled city. Other townspeople are visible in the background, walking and going about their day. The architecture appears pre-industrial European. The general atmosphere is lively, contrasting with Eren's hidden emotional turmoil. | A tense argument unfolding on a street within the walled city. The atmosphere is one of a false sense of peace being challenged by Eren's passionate anger. | A calm day in a town square near a large gate. The atmosphere is peaceful for the general populace, but tense in the immediate area of the confrontation between Eren and the soldiers. | A tense confrontation in a town square. The casual atmosphere of the off-duty soldiers is shattered by a child's angry and fearful shouting.",
