  "ambient": "A calm but imposing atmosphere. The sound of wind blowing over the vast walls suggests a quiet, high-altitude environment. The city below appears peaceful, but the immense scale of the fortifications creates an underlying sense of confinement or a looming threat. | A tense daytime confrontation on a city street. The casual attitude of the soldiers contrasts sharply with Eren's passionate anger, creating an atmosphere of foreboding complacency. | Daytime in a town near a large entry gate. The atmosphere is tense due to the confrontation between a concerned child and negligent adult soldiers. The background shows civilians going about their day. | A bustling town street with civilians milling about. The atmosphere is one of normal daily life, which contrasts with Eren's emotional state. | The scene is tense, with Eren's urgent shouting contrasting sharply with the soldiers' relaxed and complacent demeanor. The setting is outdoors within the walls, likely near a gate or common area where soldiers gather. | A bustling town street with civilians walking by. The atmosphere shifts from casual chatter among soldiers to a tense confrontation of ideals. | A tense daytime confrontation on a city street near a guard post. The atmosphere is charged with youthful frustration clashing against adult complacency.",
