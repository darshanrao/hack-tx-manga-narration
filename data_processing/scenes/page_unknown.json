  "ambient": "The scene shows a large walled city, cannons and a blast sound. Suggests war or attack. The overall atmosphere is tense and dramatic. | Outside, in front of the wall, the day seems to be clear. | A sunny day in a town. People are walking around. | The scene has an air of tension, with the soldiers seemingly having some drinks and Eren and Mikasa looking concerned. The overall atmosphere feels like something is about to happen. | A bustling town or city, likely the area where they live. People are walking around. The atmosphere is somewhat somber due to Eren crying. | Outside the walls, with soldiers present and a large wall visible. | The scene takes place outside a gate, potentially the entrance to a walled city. The atmosphere is somewhat casual, with soldiers drinking and the characters interacting.",
