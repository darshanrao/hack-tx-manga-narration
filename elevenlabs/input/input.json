    "ambient": "busy town square, sounds of people and horses, slightly somber atmosphere due to the children's mood | The scene is set near the gate of a town/city. There's a sense of everyday life mixed with the presence of soldiers. The overall atmosphere is somewhat tense due to the soldiers' behavior and the reminder of duty. | The panels transition from an indoor setting with soldiers drinking and relaxing, to a crowded street scene with civilians walking about. The atmosphere shifts from casual and relaxed to one of everyday life, with an undercurrent of the underlying tensions related to living within the walls. | The scene is set on top of a large wall with open sky and visible landscape in the background. The atmosphere is somewhat tense due to the disagreement but generally relaxed due to Hannes' perceived confidence. | The scene starts in a somewhat relaxed, possibly drunken atmosphere among the garrison members, with the sounds of them drinking and chatting. The sudden announcement of the Titan invasion shatters this atmosphere, creating a sense of urgency and chaos. The 'twitch' sound effect suggests something reacting to the news with a sudden movement. | The atmosphere is vast and expansive, emphasizing the scale of the walls and the city. The sound effect suggests a distant, possibly ominous presence or event. The scene has a neutral tone, establishing the setting. | General outdoor atmosphere near the wall, likely sunny. Sense of tension and frustration due to the confrontation.",
